👋🏻Hi~ I am a Ph.D. candidate in Ecology from China. My research interests include terrestrial ecosystems, climate change, and wildfires. I am passionate about uncovering how forest ecosystems respond to climate change and wildfires. Feel free to visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcmTdYEAAAAJ&hl) to learn more about my work.
