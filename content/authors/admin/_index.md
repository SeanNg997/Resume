👋🏻Hi~ I am a Ph.D. student in Ecology at Tsinghua University. My research interests include terrestrial ecosystems, climate change, and wildfires. I am passionate about uncovering how forest ecosystems respond to various disturbances. Feel free to visit my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rcmTdYEAAAAJ&hl) and [GitHub](https://github.com/SeanNg997/) to learn more about my work.

If you are interested in collaborating, I would be happy to connect.
