abstract: The widespread abandonment of croplands poses a severe threat to
  China's food security. However, the existing knowledge regarding the potential
  for recultivating abandoned croplands is limited. Previous studies have
  generally overestimated this potential due to inadequate assessments of their
  suitability for recultivation. In the present study, an optimized machine
  learning approach was introduced to assess, for the first time, the
  suitability of abandoned croplands for recultivation in China. In 2022, the
  total abandoned croplands in China covered 31.2 million hectares, of which
  82.54% was deemed suitable for recultivation. Recultivating abandoned
  croplands in China could substantially enhance food security, potentially
  yielding around 162 million tons annually. Moreover, crop switching can
  further increase the yield rate by up to 24.95% or energy supply by up to
  43.14%. The present study offers valuable insights to policymakers in
  determining cropping strategies, establishing strategic grain reserves, and
  managing international food trade.
