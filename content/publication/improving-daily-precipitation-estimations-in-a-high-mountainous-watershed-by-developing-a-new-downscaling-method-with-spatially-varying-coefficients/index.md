abstract: Accurate estimates of spatial patterns of daily precipitation are
  critically important for numerous hydrologic applications. However, the
  estimation of daily precipitation is still challenging, especially in regions
  with sparse observation networks and complex terrain. Although satellite
  precipitation products can offer continuous precipitation fields on a daily
  scale, the data contain large bias and coarse spatial resolution, which limit
  the application of these products in local studies. Here, we developed a new
  spatially varying coefficient downscaling approach to yield a daily
  precipitation field with high-resolution and high-accuracy in a high
  mountainous watershed. First, the random effect eigenvector spatial filtering
  (RESF) model was introduced and improved by considering the nonlinear term;
  second, the residuals were corrected by applying the simple inverse distance
  weighted (IDW) method. Using the proposed method, named RESF-IDW, the Global
  Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP) was downscaled from 0.1° to 0.01°
  by integrating reanalyzed atmospheric data and environmental variables as
  auxiliary information. The performance of RESF-IDW was evaluated and compared
  with the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method and the original
  GSMaP precipitation products at 20 national and automatic stations by using
  leave-one-out cross validation. The results show that compared to the original
  GSMaP products, RESF-IDW, RESF, GWR-IDW, and GWR exhibited improvements in
  their mean values of correlation coefficient (CC) by 24.5%, 17.9%, 12.0%, and
  3.2%, respectively. Additionally, their mean values of mean absolute error
  (MAE) improved by 31.2%, 14.9%, 18.7%, and 2.4%, respectively, while their
  mean values of root mean square error (RMSE) improved by 24.1%, 18.5%, 9.6%,
  and 3.8%, respectively. The RESF-IDW model can be used to correctly improve
  the original GSMaP product under different precipitation intensities, with
  critical success index (CSI) improvements of 38.81%, 43.14% and 44.58% for
  low, medium and high precipitation intensities, respectively. The use of
  residual correction enhances the spatial accuracy (MAE decreases by 19.43% on
  average) and the precipitation detection capability (CSI increases by 12.09%
  on average) of the RESF estimations. Based on the error metrics, the RESF-IDW
  model can be used to generate improved precipitation estimates on a daily
  scale and has a good capability for precipitation detection over different
  intensities. The proposed method in this study provides a promising way to
  generate accurate daily precipitation fields with high spatial resolution over
  data sparse and high mountain regions.
