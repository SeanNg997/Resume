abstract: "The increasing frequency and severity of heatwaves present
  significant environmental and socio-economic challenges. While both rapid
  economic expansion and sluggish growth could intensify heatwave risks, current
  research predominantly examines the heatwaves’ impacts on economic
  performance, overlooking how economic development influences heatwave risks.
  Coastal cities, particularly major ports, are pivotal in the global economy
  and are anticipated to experience the greatest increase in heatwave exposure
  (0.81 to 2.31 × 104 person-times year-1 under SSP1–2.6 to SSP5–8.5) relative
  to other urban areas. Quantifying population exposure in global coastal cities
  by 2100, we investigated the diverse effects of future economic development on
  heatwave exposure. A robust correlation between economic development and
  heatwave exposure was identified across nearly all studied coastal cities (the
  majority showing correlation coefficients > 0.8). GDP variations significantly
  affect heatwave exposure on the global average level; yet, the magnitude and
  mode of this impact vary among cities (P < 0.01, R2 = 0.90 on average). We
  highlighted 14 typical cities requiring special attention and defined three
  risk types: Development Imbalance Risk, Economic Lag Risk, and Potential Risk
  Alert, leading to possible targeted strategies for coordinated socio-economic
  and heatwave mitigation efforts. The results contribute to integrating
  sustainable economic growth with climate resilience strategies."
