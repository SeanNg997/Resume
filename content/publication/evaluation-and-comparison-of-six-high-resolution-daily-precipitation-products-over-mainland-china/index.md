abstract: Satellite-based and reanalysis precipitation products have experienced
  increasing popularity in agricultural, hydrological and meteorological
  applications, but their accuracy is still uncertain in different areas. In
  this study, six frequently used high-resolution daily precipitation products,
  including Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data
  (CHIRPS), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Integrated
  Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG),
  Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP), Precipitation Estimation
  from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Cloud
  Classification System-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CCS-CDR) and European
  Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis V5-Land (ERA5-Land), were
  comprehensively evaluated and compared in nine regions of mainland China
  between 2015 and 2019. The results reveal that, in general, GSMaP is the best
  precipitation product in different agricultural regions, especially based on
  the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC) and critical success index (CSI).
  ERA5-Land and MSWEP tend to have the highest probability of detection (POD)
  values, and MSWEP tends to have the smallest relative root mean squared error
  (RRMSE) values. GSMaP performs better at almost all precipitation levels and
  in most agricultural regions in each season, while MSWEP has the best
  performance for capturing the time series of mean daily precipitation. In
  addition, all precipitation products perform better in summer and worse in
  winter, and they are more accurate in the eastern region. The findings of this
  study will contribute to understanding the uncertainties of precipitation
  products, improving product quality and guiding product selection.
