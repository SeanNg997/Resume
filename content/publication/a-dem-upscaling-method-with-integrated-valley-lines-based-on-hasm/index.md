abstract: A new digital elevation model (DEM) upscaling method based on
  high-accuracy surface modeling (HASM) is proposed by combining the elevation
  data of the DEM and the extracted valley lines for different flow accumulation
  thresholds. The proposed method has several advantages over traditional DEM
  upscaling methods. First, the HASM ensures the smoothness of the upscaled DEM.
  Second, several DEMs with different topographic details can be obtained using
  the same DEM grid size by incorporating the valley lines for different flow
  accumulation thresholds. The Jiuyuangou watershed in Chinaâ€™s Loess Plateau was
  used as a case study. A DEM with a grid size of 5 m obtained from the local
  surveying and mapping department was used to verify the proposed DEM upscaling
  method. We established the surface complexity index to describe the complexity
  of the topographic surface and quantified the differences in the topographic
  features obtained from different upscaling results. The results show that
  topography becomes more generalized as grid size and flow accumulation
  threshold increase. At a large DEM grid size, an increase in the flow
  accumulation threshold increases the difference in elevation values in
  different grids, increasing the surface complexity index. This study provides
  a new DEM upscaling method which is suitable for quantifying topography.
