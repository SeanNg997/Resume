abstract: How the rapidly developing livestock grazing affects grassland
  aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) is uncertain. The grazing
  optimization hypothesis (GOH) predicts that appropriate grazing pressure
  benefits ANPP and that the response of ANPP to grazing intensity follows a
  single-peaked pattern, but it remains controversial. Here, we conducted a
  global meta-analysis with 376 pairs of observations for ANPP to investigate
  the responses of grassland ANPP to stocking rate and forage consumption rate
  (FCR). Results showed that there was no significant relationship between
  stocking rate and ANPP response, primarily because the effect of stocking rate
  varied according to climatic conditions. FCRs were calculated using three
  methods (FCR I, II, and III), with FCR III providing a precise estimate of the
  actual FCR. ANPP responded unimodally to FCR III on the global scale, with the
  ANPP response peaking (12 % increase) at the optimal grazing intensity (FCR
  III = 58 %). The results for FCR I and FCR II also corroborated the
  single-peaked effect of the actual FCR. Based on our preliminary evidence, we
  propose a hypothesis that the single-peaked effect of FCR is consistent on a
  global scale, but this needs to be confirmed by further research. The unimodal
  relationship between ANPP responses and grazing intensity we found supports
  the GOH and informs win-win outcomes for grassland productivity and livestock
  production.
