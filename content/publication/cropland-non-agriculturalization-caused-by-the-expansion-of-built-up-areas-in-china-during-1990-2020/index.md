abstract: The unprecedented built-up area expansion in China has resulted in a
  significant occupation of cropland. Yet, to date, we have not achieved
  continuous monitoring of the occupation of cropland by different types of
  built-up land, nor have their annual impacts on non-agriculturalization been
  revealed. Here, for the first time, we have generated a dataset spanning from
  1990 to 2020, consisting of annual areas for urban land (UL), rural
  residential land (RRL), and other built-up land (OBL) and their occupation of
  cropland at the county level across China. Subsequently, the annual
  contributions of these three types of built-up land expansion to
  non-agriculturalization in China were unveiled. Our results show that the
  average annual conversion of cropland into UL, RRL, and OBL was 1520.60 km²,
  1464.60 km², and 987.44 km², respectively, during the study period. Among
  these, only the conversion of cropland into OBL exhibited a significant
  increasing trend of 4.64 km²/a. Overall, different types of built-up land have
  distinct spatial impacts on the non-agriculturalization of cropland at the
  county level, which undergo significant changes over time. The
  non-agriculturalization of cropland in China is significantly influenced by
  the expansion of built-up areas, particularly in counties in the eastern
  regions. The northern regions are most affected by UL expansion and RRL
  expansion, followed by the southern regions. OBL expansion has significantly
  impacted the non-agriculturalization of counties in the southern regions, with
  its influence gradually extending from eastern to western China during the
  study period. Before 2015, the expansion of UL had a higher impact on
  non-agriculturalization compared to RRL and OBL. However, from 2015 to 2020,
  in 62.52% of counties, the expansion of RRL contributed more to
  non-agriculturalization than the expansion of RRL and OBL. It is suggested
  that China should pay more attention to protecting cropland from being
  occupied by RRL expansion. This study provides insights that can inform
  sustainable land use planning and facilitate the development of targeted
  cropland protection policies.
